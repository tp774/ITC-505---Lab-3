    <h1>How to Serve Custom Fonts</h1>
    <p>For this lab, I went with the font <strong>"Creepster"</strong>, and trust me, this one’s a bit different from your usual choices. Imagine walking into a haunted house—the sign above the door is written in letters that look like they’re dripping down, almost as if they’re melting right in front of you. That’s <em>Creepster</em> for you. It’s spooky, fun, and full of character!</p>

    <p>Now, would you use this font for a business report? Probably not! But for something like a Halloween party flyer or a mystery novel cover? Absolutely! <strong>Creepster</strong> is like the rebellious cousin of the more serious fonts we all know. It’s bold, playful, and definitely attention-grabbing. And the best part? Despite all its spooky vibes, it’s still totally readable—no weird symbols or hard-to-decipher letters here.</p>

    <p>So, whether you're putting together a quirky blog post, an event invitation, or just want to spice up your webpage, <strong>Creepster</strong> has got your back. It’s the font equivalent of putting on a costume and having some fun with your text. It’s bold, a little bit eerie, but doesn’t take itself too seriously. And that’s what makes it perfect for standing out in a sea of boring fonts.</p>
